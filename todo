extend Embed into PostableEmbedView
	InputFormView is (for now) identical, except that title+desc have input boxes .. is it easiest to just modify the template with jquery?

require.js - text - or whatever else is recommended - to split up templates, models, views, etc.
simple gruntfile for less, js




make some WoZ posts ({username: , text: , embed: , date: })
pretend get, render & sort them


fork -->
  routes -> user signins / user pages  / rooms
  simple pagination api (for scroll)




meanwhile, design/dream ....
