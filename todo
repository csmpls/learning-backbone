extend Embed into PostableEmbedView
	right now, EmbedFormView would be changing InputBoxView.hasEmbed - this is no good ! InputBoxView should manage its own InputFormView 
	InputFormView is (for now) identical, except that title+desc have input boxes .. is it easiest to just modify the template with jquery?

require.js - text - or whatever else is recommended - to split up templates
simple gruntfile for less, js




copy embeds to WoZ some posts ({username: , text: , embed: , date: })
and pretend get, render & sort them


fork -->
  routes -> user signins / user pages  / rooms
  simple pagination api (for scroll)


now design .. realtime, message, rooms, comments, friendships, etc
